# Dashboard Deployment Demo 
## UCBerkley FinTech Bootcamp

## Purpose

This repo presents serverless deployment of dashboards for a demo to UCBerkley FinTech Bootcamp students in `Firas Ali Obeid's` classes

* Motive is to keep students up to date with the tools that allows them to define a problem till deployment in a very short amount of time for efficient deliverables in the work place or in academia.

* Disclaimer: All references: https://blog.holoviz.org/panel_0.14.html otherwise stated in the dashboard itself.

## Objective
Deploy your dashboards easily to github pages through converting your python code to web assembly language. Once converted the dashboard is then deployed to git hub and will run real time on any browser that opens that deployment link. This is a new promising technique that will make us not need server based deplyments.
